## Ratatouille

**A rat named Remy dreams of becoming a great chef despite his family's wishes, and the obvious problem of being a rat in a decidedly rodent-phobic profession**
*When fate places Remy in the sewers of Paris, he finds himself ideally situated beneath a restaurant made famous by his culinary hero, Auguste Gusteau*
1. The late Auguste Gusteau, France’s all-time greatest culinary genius, is the author of Anyone Can Cook, the cookbook that inspires Remy's dream of becoming a chef
2. Gusteau's Paris restaurant became a landmark on the strength of his imaginative vision and masterful preparation, which simultaneously honored and played with the traditions of French cuisine. 
3. Gusteau died mysteriously soon after his restaurant was downgraded from five stars to four (by food critic Anton Ego), but his spirit lives on in his recipes and Remy’s imagination—the great chef is a recurring figure as Remy’s imaginary soul mate and counselor.
